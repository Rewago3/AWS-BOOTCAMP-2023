# Week 3 â€” Decentralized Authentication

#### Create User Pool and implement Custom Sign in Page.

Got stuck on this one. Created User pool in AWS Cognito and tried to implement the custom sign in Page. I tried so many times, but just could not connect to AWS Cognito from crudder app. 

First on opening the gitpod this is the error I got.

On googling found -
The react-scripts: command not found error mainly occurs if the dependencies are not installed or if the package-lock.json is corrupted.

After many attempts, looks like I missed out the  pipe character | in gitpot.yml
 
- name: react-js
    command: |
      cd frontend-react-js
      npm i
      
On attempting to Sign in to crudder, would always get the error

Always got the authentication error. On inspecting would get

It was really hard to conclude what was really causing the authentication error. 
I tried and followed the instructions 2/3 times, just to see if i hadn't missed anything.

I went ahead and thought i will try to skip this and try week 4. Somewhere in week 4- RDS Postgres, i ran in to the same problem.
Finally, i gave it on more try.(From the begining try -https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9obl7rVgzJw&list=PLBfufR7vyJJ7k25byhRXJldB5AiwgNnWv&index=40&ab_channel=ExamPro)

Found out this is the silly mistake I made-Cursing myself

In docker-compose.yml file all the REACT APP AWS COGNITO env variables
REACT_AWS_PROJECT_REGION:
REACT_APP_AWS_COGNITO_REGION:
REACT_APP_AWS_USER_POOLS_ID:
REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID:
were in the backend-flask:
    environment:
    
On changing and placing them in 

frontend-react-js:
    environment:
 I was able to authenticate and complete the rest of the week 3 assignments.
 Phew, happy to have completed at last.(Almost gave up on this)
